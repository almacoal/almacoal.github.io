## :material-sign-text: Summary
I’ve always been a hands-on person, with an overarching pursuit for excellent delivery and proper feedback between my clients and colleagues.
To achieve this, I have worked with several industries since 2008, to learn what led them further and what were their woes:
from food manufacturing, to wind turbine construction abroad, electronic safety and homeland security, renewable energy and utilities, fintech, insurance and telco.

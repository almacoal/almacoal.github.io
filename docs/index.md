## :material-sign-text: Summary

I’ve always been a hands-on person, with an overarching pursuit for excellent delivery and proper feedback between my clients and colleagues.
To achieve this in these last Jul'15 (On-going), I’ve worked with several industries, to learn what led them further and what were their woes:
from a Food Manufacturing plant and their specific requirements;
to a wind turbine construction site abroad and their multi-cultural, multi-asset team;
to planning electronic safety mechanisms and preparing homeland security solutions to a wide range of customers;
to maintaining and improving a management platform for Renewable generators through a multitude of protocols, automations and custom client requests;
to maintaining APIs for a british FinTech;
to API gateways and their cloud infrastructure on Insurance
and, now, moving beyond to AI architecture on Telco.

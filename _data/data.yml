      I’ve always been a hands-on person, with an overarching pursuit for excellent delivery and proper feedback between my clients and colleagues. To achieve this, I have worked with several industries since 2008, to learn what led them further and what were their woes: from food manufacturing, to wind turbine construction abroad, electronic safety and homeland security, renewable energy, fintech, and now with insurance.

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I’ve always been a hands-on person, with an overarching pursuit for excellent delivery and proper feedback between my clients and colleagues. To achieve this, I’ve worked with several industries, to learn what led them further and what were their woes: from a food manufacture plant and their specific requirements; to a wind turbine construction site abroad and their multi-cultural, multi-asset team; to projecting electronic safety mechanisms and even preparing homeland security solutions to a wide range of customers; to maintaining and improving a management platform for said wind, solar, hydro and hybrid generators through a multitude of protocols, automations and custom client requests.

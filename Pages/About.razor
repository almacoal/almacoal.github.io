            I’ve always been a hands-on person, with an overarching pursuit for excellent delivery and proper feedback between my clients and colleagues. To achieve this, I have worked with several industries since 2007, to learn what led them further and what were their woes: from a food manufacture plant and their specific requirements; to a wind turbine construction site abroad and their multi-cultural, multi-asset team; to projecting electronic safety mechanisms and even preparing homeland security solutions to a wide range of customers; to maintaining and improving a management platform for said wind, solar, hydro and hybrid generators through a multitude of protocols, automations and custom client requests; to support the inner API ‟spine” for upcoming clients for a FinTech.
